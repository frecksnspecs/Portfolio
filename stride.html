			<div class="column two-thirds">
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>STRIDE&rsquo;s (Solutions Through Research in Diet &amp; Exercise) website and overall message had become convoluted from the rotation of students running the programs and maintaining the website. Consequently, STRIDE made an effort to rebrand, requiring its evolving purpose to be communicated through its its online presence.</p>
				<p>The website needed to increase the response rate from targeted demographics and effectively communicate to STRIDE&rsquo;s diverse audience.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column third">
				<h3 class="">Goals</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Responsive website</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Increased response rate</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="">Roles</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Web Design</li>
					<li>Web Development</li>
					<li>UX Designer</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 class="centered">Research</h2>
				<div class="column half">
					<h3>Audience</h3>
					<p>The main users were students looking to get involved, researchers reading about new program studies, donors willing to donate their support, and community members hoping to learn how to improve their health. However, the website was designed so that each group had equal priority.</p>
					<p><em>Conclusion:</em> Reevaluate priority of items on the website and be able to give a specific program more visibility when they are recruiting for surveys.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="column half">
					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<p>After conducting a content inventory of the site I found that many pages were inactive and there was a lack of organization causing some pages to exist completely seperate of the main navigation. This was the outcome of content being uploaded without a purpose or place within the preexisting structure.</p>
					<p><em>Conclusion:</em> Inactive pages would be deleted or absorbed into another page. &ldquo;Programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Research&rdquo; categories needed to be clarified and redefined. This would lead to a flatter site structure that reduces chance of a user muddling through the site to find something.</p>

					<h3>Responsive Prototypes</h3>

				</div>
				<div class="column half">
					<h3>Ideation Workshops</h3>
					<p>It was important to get the program&rsquo;s stakeholders and PR team in the same room to discuss design decisions before implementation, especially during the rebrand. Their input was necessary to make the correct choices and to get everyone onboard with following through with them.</p> 
				</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class="centered">Results</h2>
		<div class="container row clearfix">
				<div class="column half">
					<h3>Clear Message</h3>
					<p>Ultimately, it was decided that the best course of action for the website would be to adopt Cal Poly&rsquo;s CMS and have the PR team absorb the role of managing web content.</p>
					<p>The design decisions combined with the new focus of the rebrand provided a strong foundation for the site to be built upon long after my graduation date.</p>
